NOTE: A good place to start examining code is sim_small, which calls fwd_step_sim which in turn calls fwd_step (which calls group_lasso) and generate_data and so on

These files contain code related to the significance testing and forward stepwise methods for group lasso discussed in the paper (insert citation)

Files:
* group_lasso.R: computing trigonometric form, first knot, pvalues
* fwd_step.R: adding a (group of) variable(s), residualizing, continuing until max.steps
* fwd_step_sim.R: main simulation function
* stop_rules.R: compute stopping index from lists of p-values
* pred_and_estim.R: compute prediction/estimation error statistics from simulation
* selection.R: compute model selection statistics from simulation 
* sim_small.R: perform small simulation and plot results
* sim_large.R: perform larger simulation and plot/compute results
* sim_fwdstep.R: simulation to analyze performance of forward stepwise
* suff_conds.R: functions for computing parameters related to conditions for forward stepwise to perform well (e.g. coherence)
* generate_data.R: produce random design matrices, signal vectors
