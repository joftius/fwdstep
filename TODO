* Refactor code, I suspect there are major issues somewhere
* Rerun simulations with _correct_ code
* Find a stopping rule
* Prove something about stopping rule
* Prove M=lambda_2 for unequal weights
* Prove M=lambda_2 for non-orthogonal designs
* Try simulations with unequal weights, non-ortho designs
* Edit better p-value section
* Spruce up the bibliography
* Try on a real data set
