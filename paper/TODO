* Prove something about stochastically larger than p-value?
** Use this to prove something about error control?

* Focal points of paper
** Global null control (at 1st step)
** When does OMP work? And can we think of it as conditional test?


** Summary of previous work
** Extension to group lasso
** (null) P-value fix
** (signal) Forward stepwise with fixed # of steps
** (signal) Stopping rules
** Real data
** Proofs: derive M, is M=lam_2?
