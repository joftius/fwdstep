abstract = { Abstract Stepwise regression is a member of a class of statistical methods which may be called opportunistic. The statistician is naturally concerned that an artifact should not be reported so he needs a stopping rule that is geared to the way in which variables are selected. A sampled permutation test is outlined which offers such a stopping rule for forward stepping. },

The C<sub>p</sub> statistic, "F to enter" <latex>$(.15 < \alpha < .25)$</latex>, a rule which minimizes the sample criterion, and one which sequentially tests the equality of the population criterion <latex>$(.25 < \alpha < .35)$</latex> are superior. For these rules, the criterion seldom differs by more than three percent, although there are considerable differences between these and some of the other rules.},

     abstract = {Model selection and inference are usually treated as separate stages of regression analysis, even though both tasks are performed on the same set of data. Once a model has been selected, one typically proceeds as though one has a fresh data set generated by the selected model. Here, we present Monte Carlo results on the coverage rates of confidence regions for the regression parameters, conditional on the selected model order. The conditional coverage rates are much smaller than the nominal coverage rates, obtained by assuming that the model was known in advance. Furthermore, the overall coverage rate is much smaller than the nominal value. A possible remedy based on data splitting is suggested.},
